# DDS-HSI Proof of Concept
## Showcase Scenarios

This folder contains the showcase scenarios developed for the proof of concept implementation of DDS-HSI.
Each sub-folder of this directory corresponds to a hypothetical piece of machinery that runs our HSI-DDS implementation.
They are interconnectable and can be run simultaneously on connected computers/in different processes.
They aim to resemble a simplified scenario of a Task Controller with an attached implement and a GNSS system.
