# DDS-HSI Proof of Concept
## Experimental Implementations

This folder contains experimental implementations that aim to show/test specific features (e.g., extensible datatypes).
As the extensible datatypes/security implementations presented in this folder use parts within the datamodel that would be incompatible/confusing to put within the proposed information mode, we choose to outsource this functions to the Experimental_InformationModel. 
The Experimental_Informationbut only serves the purpose to run the experimental features and is thus not kept consistent at all time.
