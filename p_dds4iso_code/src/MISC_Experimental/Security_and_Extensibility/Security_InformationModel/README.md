# Information Model for Experimental Security Trial Implementation

This folder contains the information model for an experimental implementation of DDS security features within our proof of concept.
Please be aware that this model might slighly deviate from the main conceptual implementation - so cautiousness is adviced when mixing this MISC implementation with the main PoC.
